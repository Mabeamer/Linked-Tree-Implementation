# Linked-Tree-Implementation

The goal of this project was to create and implement a Linked Tree Structure for geneeric elements through a pyrimid scheme.
The program follows the rules of a pyrimid scheme, the higher up a person is the more money they recieve when a recruit joins, there is also a collapse.
My goal was to finish the linkedtree implementation through the following methods:
GetRootElement: returns the element held by root
addChild: adding a parent and child node
contains: checks to see if tree contains a T target
countDown: This is a recursive method that counts the nodes in the tree.

Part 2 Testing:

Implemented testing for the following methods
addChild(Parent, Child)
size()
getRootElement()
contains()
